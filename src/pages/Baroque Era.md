# The Beginning of "Classical Music"
Oftentimes, the earliest era people would refer to as "Classical Music" starts with the those from the Baroque. Although much this era's developments stemmed from religious works from the Renaissance (1450-1600) and the Medieval period (1000-1450s), most people's journey in learning about Classical Music starts from the Baroque, where much of the theoretical musical foundations of what we know today as Western European Arts Music has cemented itself. 

## What is the Baroque Era?
The Baroque Era is an artstic style in architecture, visual arts, dance, and music, which flourished in Eruope in the early 17th century to the mid 18th century.

In reaction to Protestanism in Europe, which called for simplicity, the Catholic Church encouraged the Baroque art form that characterized flamboyancy and intricacy. 
This can be seen with the use of cartouches and stucco in architecture (see the super intricate carvings at the top!), ![](https://previews.123rf.com/images/etienjones/etienjones1203/etienjones120300029/12903714-vista-interior-de-la-decoraci%C3%B3n-de-estuco-en-estilo-barroco-de-alta.jpg)

vivid expressions and realism in sculpture and visual arts (look at that realistic angry face there), ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/%D0%94%D0%B6%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B8_%D0%9B%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%86%D0%BE_%D0%91%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8._%D0%94%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B4._01.JPG/300px-%D0%94%D0%B6%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B8_%D0%9B%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%86%D0%BE_%D0%91%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8._%D0%94%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B4._01.JPG) (Lorenzo Bernini, _David_ )

and the use of dark and richer colours to provide stark contrast of light and dark to provide emotional intensity in paintings.

> **Basically, the Baroque was all about using art to express an intense emotion (affects) and showing off the grand and elaborate details in the artwork.**

_So, how do we translate those visual examples above into music?_ 

When listening to Baroque pieces, one might pick up lots of quick notes in succesion or a few quick notes before a certain note (trills, grace notes). This is called ornamentation, which can add flare to a musical piece for the virtuoso singers and instramentalists to show off their skills or used when repeating the same sections to make each repetition seem different.

There was growing awareness to use music to evoke emotions, or affects. Following the medical theory on humors at the time, where eating and refraining from certain foods can equilibrize the imablance of bodily humors, there was growing beleif that musical emotions were another method to counter with the imbalance of humours, or spirit vapours. Lorenzo Giacomini wrote in his _Oratoni e discorsi_ that affects are not the same as emotions, and external factors like musical affects stimulate the body to alter the state of the humors. There was even a 17th century theory called the Doctrine of Affections, stating that different musical moods could and should be used to influences the affects of the listener.

In Baroque music, many pieces have distinctive movements, sections, or dances in a collection, or suite. Each distinct section presents a well-defined emotional charactersitic. Though this structure of distinct sections was carried over by the past centuries, they were mostly sections of church music to accompany a service; they were not meant to evoke a certain emotion.   

_Here are some musical characteristics that defined the Baroque musical sound:_

- Melody
    - More diverse melodic lines to incorporate:
        - Dramatic virtuoso singing
        - Idiomatic writing; basically melodies specifically written to show off the technical strentghs of each instrument
- Harmony
    - using the tonal system (the very familiar major and minor keys) rather than the modal system used in church music for the past centuries
        - this tonal system will be the basis of Western European Arts Music hamony
    - here's an example of both 
- Rhythm
    - More rhythmic unity with strict patterns rather than the smooth, indistinct rhythmic pattern in past music
- Dynamics
    - Terraced dynamics: shifitng the volume suddnely from one level to another
        - this can be done by adding voices (actual human voice or instruments) to provide volume change or textural change
        -gradual dynamic change was not possible at this time due to the technological limitations on instruments 
- Texture
    - the formation of the orchestra, a rather a stablized group of instruments that will eventually form what we know as the orchestra today, where they will contribute to the contrasting musical textures.
- Basso Continuo
    - an instrument or small ensemble that provide the harmonic founcation for the melody. This is usually the harpsichord in the background.
- Dance
    - It is important to note that dance styles were used for inspiration to compose pieces, not meant to be danced to necessarily.
