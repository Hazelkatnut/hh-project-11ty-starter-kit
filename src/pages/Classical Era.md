## The Classical of "Classical Music"
The Classical Era in music fell in sync with the Age of Enlightenment, where puruit of knowledge, rational thinking, and idealogies of equality amongst all were growing. This period is referred to as the Classical Era due to it's core values being rooted in the rediscovery and revival of the Greco-Roman art style of simplicity, clean-cut lines, and proportion, contrasting the overly ornate style of the Baroque. The biggest achievement developed was the Sonata form, a form that emphasized a strict structural form to write music, commonly employed in the popular and "massive" genres of instrumental and chamber music: sonatas, concertos, string quartets, and symphonies.

## What is the Classical Era
Following the 18th century artistic movement known as Classicism, the Arts tried to revive and emulate the culture, art, and literature of Classical Antiquity of Ancient Greece. This is characterized by order and hierarchy, simplicity, proportion,perfection, restrained emotion, and intellectual appeal.

It is quite common to see in certain European cities today where certain buildings were trying to mimic the perfect symmetry and proportion of Ancient Classcism in Ancient Greece.

Such politics Ancient Greeck Classicism were also a common topic among philosophers and intellectuals. As could be reflected in the royalty as well, there were the Absolute monarchs who pracitced their leadership based on the principles of the Enlightened; they were entrusted on the power to rule on the basis of the social contract. One influential aboslutist monarch in music was Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II, who's home was in the music capital: Vienna, of which many musicians would be attracted to the city due to its rich musical community of patrons and musicians alike.

Such revival also entertained the revival of Greek drama and music. Opera, originally an Italian invention made popular during the Baroque era, was now also a source of comedic entertainment (opera buffa, singspiel), aiming to combine singing, dancing, similar to what they thought was done in Classical Greek theatre. 

Towards the latter end of the Classical Era, it was common to hear of independent musicians; of which Mozart, Haydn were independent near the latter part of their career, and Beethoven is mostly considered an independent musicians, rather than being employed by royal courts or church service (although these roles were still quite common). 

The Enlightenment Era also affected the artistic world in terms of its tastes and audience. Like the logical order demanded from scientific inquiry, we see structures in music through the established Sonata Form, or the shift from polyphony (the multi-voiced counterpoint) to homophony (melody over a clear accopaniment). Due to the main patronage being the nobility (rather than the church and the royalty in the Baroque) due to economic order and social structure, there was the growth of more instrumental music, of which performance styles has changed to suit this need by providing a larger orchestra and standard instrumental groups and specific notations for large ensemble music (rather than sharing parts with available instruments at hand). It was also starting to become common to have "rehearsals" in the latter part of the era as patrons and audiences wanted to listen to music produced by previous generations as well. With Beethoven, especially, as instrumental technology allowed more virtuosic skill to be demonstrated, it was becoming essential for instrumentalists to be able to practice their parts with each other, thus rehearsing, rather than sightread their parts during performance (a norm during Baroque era performances).

- Melody
    - Symetrical melody, balanced phraes and cadences
    - Easy to remember; tuneful
    - Sometimes characterized as "elegant", "light"
- Harmony
    - The tonal system expanded to further develop the tonic-dominant relationship (the first and fifth degree notes in a tonal harmony scale)
        - Simply, in the tonal system, there are 24 main scales, 12 major and 12 minor. Each scale has 8 degrees which create an "octave". 
        - Ex. Using the C major scale, we have C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C. In this case, our C is the first degree (tonic/I; number 1 in roman numerals) and our G is the fifrth degree (dominant/V; number 5 in roman numerals). The relationship between these two notes are emphasized in order to establish the harmony and has become common practice to use them in Classical era pieces.

    Here's a video explanation that explains chord progressions to give a better sense of how the scale in a tonal system works 
    
- Rhythm
    - Favoured dance rhythms and regularly recurring accents to establish rhythm 
- Dynamics
    - Better instrumental technology allowed for more gradual increase (crescendo) and decrease (decrescendo/diminuendo) in volume, and continously changes throughout the piece
- Texture
    - Homophonic texture (melody over chordal accompaniment). 
- Instrumentation
    - The orchestra is now standardized into 4 families: strings, woodwinds, brass, percussion. The piano is also coming into prominence as more a soloist.
- Musical Form
    - The Sonata Form comes into development (development attributed especially at the "Father of the String Quartet and Symphony": Joseph Haydn).
    - With the artistic movement that calls for balance and proportion, the Sonata Form does exactly that. It is a 3-part musical form that can organize music, which was developed from the ternary form used commonly in Baroque pieces (such as the Da Capo Aria): Exposition (section A) -Development (Section B)-Recapituation (Section A repeated again, but different).

### Let's apply the above traits into music 

**Below are some popular Classical pieces to provide our examples:**

https://youtu.be/CdW6R1mkBUI

J. Stamitz: Symphony in F, Op. 4, No. 1 (0:00-3:16)

- The father of the Mannheim orchestra; a school of performance that highlighted the crescendos and diminuendos in the entire orchestra and required every player to be disciplined and skilled instrumentalists, just like the logic and order required of Classicism's characteristics.
- This orchestra is organized similarly to how we would listen to a modern day orchestra, although emphasis is still placed on the strings.
- A preliminary version of Sonata Form; it is symetrical that the first and last sections mimics the other
- easy to remember melody
- Harmony is mostly based around the tonic and dominant chords throghout the piece, not much harmonic exploration.

J. Haydn: Trumpet Concerto in E-flat major Hob. VIIe/1 

- _For all of you "Squid Game" fans out there_
- Due to better instrument technology, the brass instruments were starting to also have as solo instruments in chamber music and concertos (orchestra accompnying a soloist). 
- This was inspired by a dance form - the rondo, where the first section keeps returning with various other musical material in between those repeititons.
- Dynamic control of the trumpet was also better improved in its construction so it allowed for more dynamic changes (especially on the quieter side).
- It also sounds very grand and welcoming, like a grand entrance (similar to the function of an announcement on Squid Game), contributing to its elegant style of Classcism.

W.A. Mozart: Serenade No. 13 for Strings "Eine Kleine Nachtmusik" K. 525

- The sonata allegro form 
- Sounds extremely elegant, possibly written for public entertainment 
- The second movement (at 5:54) is a slow movement, a common section to contrast and mirror the quick sections before and after the slow movements. It is also another exercise of balance between lyricism and restraint of emotion. 
- The homophonic texture is quite evident even though it is for a string ensemble - the melody is usually played in the 1st violins while the rest provides accompaniment. 
- The accents are quite important in order to establish the rhythm, whether to reflect a dance rhythm or a stately rhythm for the piece overall.

L.v. Beethoven: Piano Sonata in C minor, op. 13 "Pathetique"

- A common genre at the time was the piano sonatas, which were key in bringing out this new keyboard instrument to a level of stardom of its own. It has difficult piano techniques which make it essential that the instrumentalist needed to be able to rehearse and practice this on their own prior to performance
- There is a slow introduction prior to its symmetrical Sonata Form, it achieves its own balance of lyricism and restraint. 
- Harmonically, as Beethoven was experimenting with music in different ways than his Classical era predecessors, decides to establish the tonic key by exploring other degrees of the tonal harmony scale. But, in keeping with symmetry, they are harmonically symetrical in the exposition and recapitulation. 
- Melodically, the motif repeats throughout, which provides a tuneful idea to it, and is a tool to balance the phrases and cadences  

Listeners would probably associate music from the Classical era as "elegant" and "light" due to the balance and proportion required of the musical tastes of the time. Oftentimes, the music from this era is accompanied with movie scenes of the nobility mingling or even played in high-class restaurants, which can make people attribute the music to the upper class audience. Although many pieces were dedicated to or written to these high class patrons (who would have the composers under their employment or through comission), it's main goal was to provide a sense of entertainment. Whether as background music or something for enjoyment in a concert hall to feel relaxed and mingle (common concert etiquette at the time). Indeed, these were also written in mind of many skilled musicians, such as the trumpet concerto or the piano sonata, where the music was written for a skilled performer for an upcoming concert. 

In contrast to the extremely embelished Baroque period, they were in no way less enjoyed by their audiences. It was also a product of the philosophies and societal changes of their time, where the musician plays a larger role in public life, and starts to gain more freedom in their career. The symmetry and balance asked of the artistic movement has created important musical developments on ordering music (harmonically, melodically, or through form) and has started to serve more to the entertainment sphere as the Enlightened monarchs start to invest more into music as pure entertainment rather than for a specfic purpose.
