## The Classical of "Classical Music"
The Classical Era in music fell in sync with the Age of Enlightenment, where puruit of knowledge, rational thinking, and idealogies of equality amongst all were growing. This period is referred to as the Classical Era due to it's core values being rooted in the rediscovery and revival of the Greco-Roman art style of simplicity, clean-cut lines, and proportion, contrasting the overly ornate style of the Baroque. The biggest achievement developed was the Sonata form, a form that emphasized a strict structural form to write music, commonly employed in the popular and "massive" genres of instrumental and chamber music: sonatas, concertos, string quartets, and symphonies.

## What is the Classical Era
Following the 18th century artistic movement known as Classicism, the Arts tried to revive and emulate Classical antiquity of Ancient Greece. This is characterized by order and hierarchy, clear and simple texture to distinguish between parts and sections such as clear distinction between melody and harmony, one musical section fron another. 
The Enlightenment Era also affected the artistic world in terms of its tastes and audience. Like the logical order demanded from scientific inquiry, we see structures in music through the established Sonata Form, or the shift from polyphony (the multi-voiced counterpoint) to homophony (melody over a clear accopaniment). Due to the main patronage being the nobility (rather than the church and the royalty in the Baroque) due to economic order and social structure, there was the growth of more instrumental music, of which performance styles has changed to suit this need by providing a larger orchestra and standard instrumental groups and specific notations for large ensemble music (rather than sharing parts with available instruments at hand).
