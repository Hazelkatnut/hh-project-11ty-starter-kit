description: "How to Describe the Ever-Changing World"

## Overview
It was all about change. Quick changes, radical changes, wars, ideas, mass automation, crowded cities, everything was changing in a blink of an eye! How were people able to express these changes and worries? People were also trying to find new ways to express music as they were getting tired of all the lengthy Romanticism and traditional means of teaching with the tonal system and composition styles. It was all old fashion. Paris was rising in fame to become the main city of the Arts in Europe, while New York was also becoming its own Arts centre in the United States. There was much more inspiration taken from non-European cultures, such as more use of pentatonic scales popular in Asian music, mimicking instrumentation, inspiration of Jazz and Blues from African American music from New York's Harlem community, and even atonality: a theory from Arnold Schoenburg to eradicate the entire foudnation of Western Classical music: the tonal system. The -isms were popping up everywhere, not only in visual arts, but also in music. Interestingly, not a lot of people attribute the main characteristics of modernism to the Classical sound, because its too plain strange and not relatable for everyday listeners (unlike what the composers intended, to describe modern and current life with new musical techniques so people can better understand the music). Even for musicians and listeners today, intially it takes a while to get used to the sounds of Modernism. 

## What is Modernism? 
It all started with Wagner's _Gesamkunstwerk_, German for "Total Art Work", a term Wagner created in the late 19th century to describe his operas (or music dramas, as he called them): a huge collaborative effort where the drama, music, plot, and visuals were all integral parts of the opera: nothing was seen as "extra" or "for show", each element was unified and connected to the music, the story, the acting, the set design, for a reason. Well, many modernists liked this notion and followed his footsteps: being actively involved as the librettist (story writer), composer, and director of their operas and ballets. 

Other than Wagner's "Total Art Work", much of Romanticism learnt in Conservatories and Academies was rejected from modernists as they felt like it was not able to describe the realities of current life. How can you convey the truth: the expression (not just beauty or herosism, but the ugly, the Freudian subconscious), reality of what is being seen (the horrors of war, not idolizing the Revolution), how there are many perspectives in one frame or one person as they talk to you. The -isms were quickly created by artists, critics, or historians (after the movement) to describe the various movements happening. Such examples were the lush and rich harmonies, the never-ending flowing melodies, playing with more complex rhythms (polyrhythm, constant changing meters), reacting against the complexity of Western Art Music traditions by embracing more popular styles, and continously inventing new trends in music (just like in visual arts, literuatre, drama, and film).

Since there were so many trends and artist influxes that were in various artistic circles, I will highlight some trends that are considered major contributions to the history of Classical Music:

Impressionism (1890s-1930s) - Termed by critics, it was to describe the "in the moment" period that the art is trying to convey. It is not trying to portray the picture as a whole. The most difinitive example that "started" the trend was Monet's _Impression, Sunrise_, which captured the exact moment of the light on the water, the water's movement, without excess detail on the people in the water, nor the boats and trees in the background.

C. Monet: _Impression, Sunrise_

Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel were considered impressionists, although they did not particularly like the label critics gave them. It is characterized by the use of the whole tone scale, embracing dissonance (unlike traditionally where there was a need to resolve dissonances, aka uncomfortable sounding chords) shape of the melody with notes very close together, blurry sense of rhythmic meter, wider use of the orchestra's winds and brass for added "colour", these notes together made the music sound dreamy - like a blur, similar to the brushstrokes on Monet's painting, very "in the moment". This style prominent in France.

Video explanation on Music Impressionism

Expressionism (1900-1930s) - A Central European (mainly German) style in reaction to the fluffy, blurry French Impressionism, it seems like its complete opposite. Impressionists was all about the outer world, while Expressionists were all about the inner world, further inspired by Freudian theory of subconsciousness and desires. In visual arts, it is all about the ugly and sharp contrasting colours, murky colours, focusing on that very subject's emotional being. The most famous example would be Edvard Munch's _The Scream_, where you can see a clearly distressed individual on the bridge with all these murky colours surroudning his body, yet there are 2 other people on the bridge who do not care about this person, and the outer frames of the image display a bright sunset. This is clearly the inner turmoils of this individual.

E. Munch: _The Scream_

It is characterized by wide spaced and angular melodic lines, instruments at their most extreme registers (the highest and lowest pitches), and even the reason for atonality's appearance: the invention of the Twelve-Tone Scale by Arnold Schoenberg: to get to those extremes that could never be possible with traditional Classical music harmonies. It sounds intense, uncomfortable, ugly, in-your-face, but that's the point! It makes people face them right there on stage so they have to think about the ugliness.

Here is a video on atonality and how it is used by 20th century composers

Neoclassicism (1920s-50s) - The revival of the musical styles of the Baroque and Classical eras. Revival of previous eras were popular trends throughout the generations, and modernists sought to revive the music of the masters and revive them in their modernist language. They kept the Classical ideas of symmetry, balance, proportion in form, the chamber music genres that populated the aristocratic buildings of the Enlightenemnt, but now brought to the concert stage. They also revived the fugue and counterpoint from the Baroque era, something that was mostly ignored after Conservatory graduation by Romantic composers.

Of course, not every composer "belonged" to a certain artistic -ism, sometimes they compose music that follows one trend and later another, sometimes they are inspired by one and wanted to compose in that style. Sometimes their composing abilities just happen to fit the trends that were popular. 

- Melody
    - Not a primary element of the music anymore
    - Does not have to be symmetrical, lyrical, just has to have a drive to move the music forward in the way the music should be (whether something dreamy, something forthright, something shocking).
- Harmony
    - Embracing dissonance. It was always expected to "resolve" the uncomfortable or tension that is caused by dissonances, that is, an interval/chord that played by itself, sounds strange. 
    
                                    _There's an apple in the tree,_ 
    
    - You would expect me to complete it since there's a comma, but I just left it there, so now you probably seem a bit confused as to why I would leave it without completion. That's what a dissonance sounds like, the feeling that something has to complete it. Well, modernists decided to just let dissonances be, and use that uncomfortable/confusion/tension to their advantage through explicit uncomfortableness or blurriness.

    Short (quite theoretical) video on consonant (nice soudning) vs dissoance (tension/unconfortable sounding) intervals 
    - Atonality is another popular harmonic trend, especially with the development of the Twelve-Tone Technique by Schoenberg, where he completely turned the table on Western Art Music: the concept of tonality was just...gone. There was not one chord/note that was the main one. Now, each of the 12 pitches on the scale have equal importance as they must all be played, and allows for a combination that was previously considered "ugly/forbidden". Such as really, really extreme dissonances, or really nice consonants.

    Again, quite theoretical video on the Twelve-Tone Technique, but when you get to atonality, there is no way to explain it without getting technical.
    
- Rhythm
    - Rather than the standard duple (2/4), triple (3/4, Waltz rhythms), or quadruple meter (common time, 4/4), non-symmetrical rhythm using odd numbers of 5,7,9,11.and 13 were explored quite elaborately.
    - Meter can also change very regularly, such as every phrase, even every bar. The composer who was known for this was Igor Stravinsky, who was able to incorporate them into ballet as well.
    - Polyrhythm (the use of 2 seperate meters at a time) became popular, and started to achieve something similar to the rhythmic complexity of African and Asian rhythms.
- Instrumentation
    - Rather than the string section always being the principal instruments heard in orchestra or chamber music, wind and brass instruments were starting to became more commonly used as principal instruments in these large ensemble genres. They were used for their colour changes, their timbres, not purely for special effects or solo instruments. They could also bring out the lines in counterpoint
    - "darker" instruments, such as the violas, bassons, trombones, those in the middle registers, were starting to get more attention in music.
    - the large orchestra was becoming much smaller and more varied. Instead of mainly string quartets, there are wind emsebles, brass ensembles, a weird combination of string, wind, brass, and piano. Any combination and any number of players were possible. 
    - The piano and harp start to play larger roles in orchestra, but not as a soloist.
- Musical Form
    - Quite various, but it was leaning towards a more balanced, proportional form, similar to the forms found in Baroque and Classical eras. The 1-hour long symphonies that prevailed in the Romantic era were cut much shorter, and could range from a few  minutes to maybe 30 minuts long symphonies
    - Popular music also made it's way into Classical Music, especially ragtime and blues, creating a new source of inspiration for composers who were tired of the Western Art Music tradition. Jazz also made its way from America to France, surging the 1920s Golden Age of parties and lavish lifestyles after World War I.


**Let's start off with some popular Modernist pieces people think about that are referred to as "Classical Music":**
will add more text later, just making notes for myself now

https://youtu.be/8O-1wkQ-6T0

C. Debussy: Claire de Lune 

- Impresionist style
- able to convey the dreamy image through the bluriness of the harmony (whole tone harmonies)
- melody is not entirely singable, but is memorable enough to know what it is, and is not the main focal point of the music
- due to syncopation (strong beats displaced in other parts of the meter), the meter does not seem emphasized, which alludes to that peaceful, nightime feeling
- Lots of parallel intervals, which made the music seem like it was "gliding", also a big characterstic for Impressionism

A. Schoenberg Pierrot Lunnaire, Op. 21, I. "Mondestrunken"

- Expressionist style
- Use of atonality and the 12-tone technique - each of the 12 pitches are treated equally. The feeling of not having a stable tonal pitch to land on makes the piece present better: a narrator lost in its path full of despair.
- The entire work is a 3-part song cycle (collectiong of songs) of music based on various poems by the Albert Giraud. The narrator is a drunk man wandering in the nightime talking to himself about love, religion, sex, violence, crime, his home, and his past that haunts him.
- Very angular melodic lines (and harmonic lines)
- Creative orchestration for a small ensemble (flute, piccolo, clarinet, bass clarinet, violin, viola, cello, piano) + vocal soloist.
- The entire song cycle includes some popular Baroque musical forms such as the canon, fugue, rondo, passacaglia, and countepoint
- To add to the Expressionist style, the vocalist uses a technique called Sprechstimme/Sprechgesang, directing the vocalist to use specified rhythms and pitches but not to sustain its pitch, allowing it to drop or rise similar to German speech patterns. It allows for more shrills and haunting tones to better emphasize the text.

I. Stravinsky: Le Sacre du printemps (The Rite of Spring), Danse Sacrale 

- This final dance in the entire ballet is known especially for its constant changing rhythm. It is joked by orchestral members that it is extremely difficult for the players and the conductor to keep time because it is so irregular (odd number meters) and always changing.
- The harmony is an exaple of polychords, stacking two traditional harmony chords together to make an even more dissonant chord. As this is a sacrificial dance, the use of this harmony in a striking manner makes it even more dance-like and ritual-like.
- Play with syncopation and accents is another aspect to the rhythm - in one part, to help the dancer keep count during her performance, and for the orchestra to give the feeling of being lost into the dancer's dance as she dances her way to death.
- The subject matter is modernist idea - the idea of retrieving folk tales of non-European ancestry started to gain speed after Romanticism. Although the plot is based off a fake tale of Russian tribe, it allowed Stravinsky to use Russian folk melodies and incorporate them in his music. The trend of using folk melodies to inspire or incorporate played a part in incoproating popular music into the Classical Music repetoire.

G. Gershwin: Rhapsody in Blue

- An experimental piece in attempt to bring the Jazz genre into the Classical reptoire. Gershwin himself was a Jazz pianist and wanted to bring an often looked-down upon popular genre into more academic sphres. 
- Neoclassical hints where it required an Classical orchestra, although replaced some instruments with more brass and percussion. Additionally, this piece can be seen as a concerto as well, since the piano is considered the soloist
- Due to its influence from African-American musical styles, rhythmic aspects such as syncopation was extremely important
- Harmonies leaned more into Jazz harmonies, wanting it to seem like Jazz brass bands and imporvisatory performances from the Harlem jazz community. 

Modernism is such a widespread genre that it itself has a lot more to say. Although they would not be instantly recognized as Classical Music, nor were they meant to be seen as especially academic works like they are today, it achieved a goal in the "shock factor"; making people seem in awe of new trends in the Arts and to reflect on how the music plays into their current life (although not many patrons of these musics did entirely understand it). So much so, even today's audiences need to read it the background of the music a bit before understanding the context of the music. What's ironic was that these pieces were meant to reflect the modern life of the 20th century, and now they are seen as academic works essential to study in Classical Music History.

Music has come a long way from the past centuries, and has changed very drastically. These are only slight overviews of what Classical Music has to offer, and what contributes to the Classical Music sound.
