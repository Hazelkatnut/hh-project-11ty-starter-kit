# Welcome
Hello! This is a historical exploration to the development of what we call Classical Music today. We associate it with a certain sound, such as Bach's Cello Suite #1 in G major (that famous melody that Yo Yo Ma likes to play), Mozart's Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, Beethoven's Fur Elise, and the list goes on. Classical Music has stereotypes that continue into today's day and age: maybe it seems elitist, it always sticks to tradition and makes it difficult for wider public accessibility. These are some things we can explore here. Of course, these stereotypes are not completely wrong: Classical music was originally written for aristocratic patrons, therefore seeming very high brow. But it was eventually written for the wider general public after the Industrial Revolution. There is this tendancy to stick to tradition, by certain scholars, performers, critics, and listerns, but that doesn't mean all of them sticked to tradition. People did try to stray away from tradition to create modern and contemporary versions of what they learnt as tradition, even completely disregard tradition during Modernism (late 19th to mid 20th century). So, how did Classical Music earn its title of being "Classical"? Western European Arts Music has quite a long history, so let's dive in.
