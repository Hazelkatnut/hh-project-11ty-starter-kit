<p>The Romantic Era was one where the concept of the individual and virtuoso musician started to flourish. Music was becoming more readily available to the masses due to more affordable methods of being able to come across Classical music: the Industrial Revolution allowed for instruments to be more easily purchased, more people were able to afford music lessons or send children to study music in Conservatories, music was not especially reliant on purely the nobility and can be written for the the average middle-class venues such as concert halls and opera theatres. The idea of individual expression and display of technical prowess was on the rise, and the instrumentalist and the composer was starting to form a distinct line, similar to today where even the instrumentalist could earn fame without having to compose music.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-romantic-era" tabindex="-1">What is the Romantic Era?<a class="tdbc-anchor" href="#what-is-the-romantic-era" aria-hidden="true">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p>Romanticism was all the rage in Europe, especially with the uproar of the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution by the turn of the 19th century, where ideas such as liberalism, individualism, and nationalism was taking place in society and politics. It was a reaction against the strict, logical thinking that occured with the Scientific Revolution in its previous century, and the social norms of 18th century Europe. It emphasized the emotions of the individual self, the weariness of science and industrialization in favour of nature, and took inspiration from the heroism by looking back into the ideals of Medieval society.</p>
<p>These ideas were presented prominently in the Arts, which were vastly created with subject material that was more able to describe the lifestyles and imaginations of a wider audience: embracing inspiration from the distant past, the inner turmoil of the individual, the herocisim and glorification of death. Because artists were branching outside of confined rules for inspiration, other sources such as long-lost folktales, spiritual sightings, exoticism, were all used to describe the glorious distant past, the exciting adventures that can be found outside one's daily life, and the emotional or spiritual connections that can only expressed about their deep desires.</p>

<p>Popularly studied in school, Romantic literature and poetry were known for their ability to emote and a vehicle to dive into the personal expressions of the author and their characters. It was usually emotionally driven, the focus was always on the self, and allowed that freedom to express human nature. It also questioned society's quick-building industries and institutions in favour of returning to a free-spirited nature, a scenery commonly visited in many forms of Art.</p>
<p>Similarly in music, composers rid of the rigidity and structure of the Classical Era by taking previous developments of music and exploring as much as possible within and outside those boundaries. Beethoven was credited to being one main contributor to the development of the Romantic Era due to his radical ideas, musically and socially, that made him seem like the Romantic artist: his belief in Revolutionary ideas for &quot;LibertÃ©, FranternitÃ©, EqualitÃ©&quot;, and his musical ideas that seem to flow endlessly and moving in and out of sturctural boundaries, criticized during his day but eventually accepted years after his death and was deemed a &quot;genius&quot;, a celebrated concept for any Romantic artist that has been determined to produce orignal work from &quot;nothing&quot;.</p>
<p>New genres were created or developed immensely for the Romantic purpose, and has reflected well on society's reception to Classical music. The upright piano was becoming a staple in middle-class homes, and was an accessible method to learning and playing Classical music. It was also attractive to amateurs where unlike other string or wind instruments, one person could play both the melody and harmony together. Or in other cases, it was useful for intimate settings where friends and acquantancses can gather and play together, whether it was four-hand piano arrangments of large works such as symphonies and operas or chamber music of quartets or a vocalist/solo string or wind instrumentalist with a piano accompaniment.</p>
<p>Such intimate settings lead to a common social-artistic trend of the time: the Salon. It was a gathering of artists and intellectuals in one's home where each member would discuss current trends in the Arts, society, and politics. Musical salons especially would have performers play a specific program for an intimate group, similar to the concept of the &quot;recital&quot; we have today. Below is an artistic imagination of what a Salon would look like with images of various well-known artists; musicians Franz Liszt, Niccolo Paganini, Giacomo Rossini, and novelists George Sand, Alexandre Dumas Sr. and Victor Hugo.</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Josef_Danhauser_Liszt_am_Fl%C3%BCgel_1840_01.jpg" alt="">
Josef Danhauser <em>Liszt at the Piano</em></p>
<p>The recital and the concert allowed a new path for independent musicians: the virtuosos, soloists who excelled at their instrument through technical prowess. Liszt and Paganini were and still famous for their virtuosic abilities and their shows. They can be seen as the equivalent of today's rockstars as they garnered many fans (Liszt especially, having lots of female fans) through their new compositions or arrangmenets that had much technical difficutly but delivered them with ease while performing tricks. Paganini once purposely broke all 3 of his strings one-by-one so he would perform the rest of the difficult music on one string. Liszt popularized the current practice of piano performance: memorizing all his music while performing and turning the piano to the side so the audience can see his face (rather than seeing the pianist's back or hidden behind the orchestra as common in the past). It was essentially a large show but very few succesful musicians were able to pull them off, and eventually these difficult technical abilities were written into modern day requirements in music performance syllabi.</p>

<p>Programatic music was another large trend that took off from the second half of the 19th century. Inspired by the connection of various types of art working together, program music was based off the opera overture, the short piece prior to the opera to give the audience an idea of what is to happen in the plot. It allowed composers to combine their favorite works of literature to base the music from, and included a small pamphlet for the audience to understand how each part of the music relates to a part of the story/poem. Like operas in the Romantic era, it was able to convey political and moral issues, and even various folktales and fairytales, which was quite important to the rising sense of nationalism and liberalism across Europe. Richard Wagner would eventually carve out a new genre, <em>Gesamkuntswerk</em> in attempt to combine everything as one piece of cohesive artwork: drama, music, set design, plot, rather than regarding the music as seperable from the drama where it was common for plots to be nonsensical and mainly pay attention to only the music.</p>
<ul>
<li>Melody
<ul>
<li>Free-flowing, expansive, lyrical, more varied</li>
<li>may have more chromatic inflections</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Harmony
<ul>
<li>Increased use of chromaticism</li>
<li>More adventurous in exploring the harmonies of the entire tonal system (rather than much emphasis placed on the tonic and dominant)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rhythm
<ul>
<li>much more rhythmic diversity througout a piece</li>
<li>The concept of rubato (stolen time) becomes more common place as a tool of expression (to slow down or speed up certain beginnings and endings of phrases)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dynamics
<ul>
<li>Used extensively, was a way to capture the individual and the extreme emotion the music is portraying</li>
<li>Much wider range of dynamics, including sudden changes or very large gradual changes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Texture
<ul>
<li>Homophonic texture, although polyphony (similar to the Baroque era) starts to become used again near the end of the era</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Form
<ul>
<li>No strict form that must be followed. In fact, breaking traditional ideas of form from the Classical era was quite common (such as single-movement rather than multi-movement sonatas and symphonies). The important idea is the ability to capture the emotion or story of the piece.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Instrumentation
<ul>
<li>Allowed for better technical skills across various instruments which allowed for the virtuso performer.</li>
<li>Since it was based much on the composer's rendition of their individual expression, the musical score was much stricter in terms of instruction for the performer</li>
<li>Much larger orchestra (Baroque: 15 people, Classical: 20-40 people, Romantic: maybe as large as 100 people) with new instrument additions to display a wider sound and texture range (ex. the tuba, English horn, saxaphone).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Epression
<ul>
<li>Expression is no longer restraint, it can represent almost anything thought to mind: the atmosphere, the mod, interest to display the strange and macabre</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Below are some popular Romantic pieces to provide our examples:</strong></p>
<div id="eOjO4ekcJQA" class="eleventy-plugin-youtube-embed" style="position:relative;width:100%;padding-top: 56.25%;"><iframe style="position:absolute;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" title="Embedded YouTube video" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eOjO4ekcJQA" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>N. Paganini: Caprice No. 24 in A minor</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a modern example of what violin virtuoso Paganini might actually do when he gave his flashy performances: playing impressive technical things on his instrument while also doing other wild things (although I doubt hula hoops were invented in his time).</li>
<li>Paganini was also trying out new techniques with the violin, including holding it in the position that is common for modern violin playing today.</li>
<li>This was in a free flowing form -&gt; it was a theme with various variations that tackle a different technical ability, but it did include various charactersitics of Romantic music such as the use of rubato in the slower variations and a more adventurous harmonic language (although did not deviate too much away from the standard Classical style of tonic and dominant emphasis).</li>
<li>This type of performance could also be common in salon playing, since it only required a solo violinist to play.</li>
</ul>
<div id="5HgqPpjIH5c" class="eleventy-plugin-youtube-embed" style="position:relative;width:100%;padding-top: 56.25%;"><iframe style="position:absolute;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" title="Embedded YouTube video" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5HgqPpjIH5c" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>H. Berlioz: Symphonie Fantastique</p>
<p>*Since this clip is so long, I would recommend listening to the 4th (39:58) and 5th (44:28) movements since those are the more exciting portions of the symphony</p>
<ul>
<li>A huge orchestra with invented instruments (the octobass) for lower range notes. There is a large sonal range (from as high as piccolos to as low as tubas and the invented octobass).</li>
<li>Extremely long piece (almost 1 hour performance time), which was becoming the norm for Romantic pieces in order to express as much as the composer wanted to.</li>
<li>It is a well-known programatic symphony where each movement described a strong desire for a certain actress he fell in love with.</li>
<li>This is a 5-movement symphony, without any restraints or boudnaries to the standard 4-movement symphony of symmetry (fast-slow-fast-fast tempos for each movement). There were various rhthymic drives, harmonic language, and large dynamic and melodic range for this piece.</li>
<li>This piece takes Romanticism to heart, of using the personal desires and hauntings as inspiration for the entire program (story). It starts with yearning and passion to meet his beloved (movement 1), then partcipating in a ball reminiscent of the Classical ideals of balance and symmetry with its form and style (movement 2), then loneliness that surrounds the composer's emotions (movement 3), killing his beloved and knowingly heading towards his death penalty (movement 4), and finally facing Hell where he sees Witches holding a sabbath in his funeral (movement 5).</li>
<li>The main importance to this piece was the idÃ©e fixe, French for &quot;fixed idea&quot;, which can be explained like a recurring motive played througout each movement as a method to show how his desire seeps througout each movement, whether it was a passionate movement, the movement where Berlioz dreamt of killing his crush, or tied up by witches in the final movement to face his wrongdoings.</li>
</ul>
<div id="Gy5UHK4EeM8" class="eleventy-plugin-youtube-embed" style="position:relative;width:100%;padding-top: 56.25%;"><iframe style="position:absolute;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" title="Embedded YouTube video" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Gy5UHK4EeM8" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>F. Chopin: Fantaisie Impromptu in C-Sharp minor Op. 66</p>
<ul>
<li>Much chromaticism in the melody and harmony, seemingly never-ending</li>
<li>Impromptu itself already gives a hint to say that it is meant to be free flowing and spontaneous (though there is still some structure given to this form)</li>
<li>Also meant for a performance given a salons, for intimate settings, since it is a piece meant for enjoyment that only required a single piano</li>
<li>A rhthymic challenge for the player is cross-rhythm - meaning they have to balance two different complicated rhythm patterns on each hand in order to give it a specific rhythmic drive</li>
<li>It is also free flowing in the way that the melody seems like a improvisation - it keeps going, uses trills and fast 16th notes and rubato to make it feel like the melody is spontaneous.</li>
</ul>
<div id="XttF0vg0MGo" class="eleventy-plugin-youtube-embed" style="position:relative;width:100%;padding-top: 56.25%;"><iframe style="position:absolute;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" title="Embedded YouTube video" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XttF0vg0MGo" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>G. Verdi: Va, pensiero (Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves) from <em>Nabucco</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Verdi was seen as Italy's nationalist composer -&gt; although througout his life he had his ups and downs with this label, but his operas were a way for the Italian government to reunite all the Italian states to became one large country: Italy, in the mid 1800s.</li>
<li>Although based on a biblical work, it was given focus to the Jewish population, a minority population in Europe, which was often done in a poor light in the Arts. This message was a means of hoping to reunite and face the challenges of building everyone into a single nation.</li>
<li>This opera was one that put Verdi into the spotlight and it was this chorus that was sung during his funeral to celebrate the work his music has done in uniting Italy into one country.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many, many more examples from the Romantic era, but these pave good introductions to what the general scene of Romantic music was heading towards: virtuosity, many means to express various means with large lengths, instruments, flowing melodies, harmonic language, and rhythms, but also the salon culture, where artists would gather to share ideas and compose specific pieces for intimate performances (the modern day recital). There are of course many other genres of music that were able to encapsulate these ideas: character pieces (short pieces or collections to describe a character or story), Lieder (German poems put to song for vocal solist and piano accompniment), opera (using a wider source of libretto such as folktales, imaginations of anything non-European, nationalism, rather than a purely religious work or a comedic work that was not as accessible to a wider audience). Music was really spreading to the masses, whether as a performer, a listener, or a composer.</p>
