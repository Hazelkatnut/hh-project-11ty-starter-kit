<p>Oftentimes, the earliest era people would refer to as &quot;Classical Music&quot; starts with the those from the Baroque. Although much this era's developments stemmed from religious works from the Renaissance (1450-1600) and the Medieval period (1000-1450s), most people's journey in learning about Classical Music starts from the Baroque, where much of the theoretical musical foundations of what we know today as Western European Arts Music has cemented itself.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-baroque-era" tabindex="-1">What is the Baroque Era?<a class="tdbc-anchor" href="#what-is-the-baroque-era" aria-hidden="true">🔗</a></h2>
<p>The Baroque Era is an artstic style in architecture, visual arts, dance, and music, which flourished in Eruope in the early 17th century to the mid 18th century.</p>
<p>In reaction to Protestanism in Europe, which called for simplicity, the Catholic Church encouraged the Baroque art form that characterized flamboyancy and intricacy.
This can be seen with the use of cartouches and stucco in architecture (see the super intricate carvings at the top!), <img src="https://previews.123rf.com/images/etienjones/etienjones1203/etienjones120300029/12903714-vista-interior-de-la-decoraci%C3%B3n-de-estuco-en-estilo-barroco-de-alta.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>vivid expressions and realism in sculpture and visual arts (look at that realistic angry face there), <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/%D0%94%D0%B6%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B8_%D0%9B%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%86%D0%BE_%D0%91%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8._%D0%94%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B4._01.JPG/300px-%D0%94%D0%B6%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B8_%D0%9B%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%86%D0%BE_%D0%91%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8._%D0%94%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B4._01.JPG" alt=""> (Lorenzo Bernini, <em>David</em> )</p>
<p>and the use of dark and richer colours to provide stark contrast of light and dark to provide emotional intensity in paintings.
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/The_Calling_of_Saint_Matthew-Caravaggo_%281599-1600%29.jpg/450px-The_Calling_of_Saint_Matthew-Caravaggo_%281599-1600%29.jpg" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Basically, the Baroque was all about using art to express an intense emotion (affects; pronounced ah-fects) and showing off the grand and elaborate details in the artwork.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>So, how do we translate those visual examples above into music?</em></p>
<p>When listening to Baroque pieces, one might pick up lots of quick notes in succesion or a few quick notes before a certain note (trills, grace notes). This is called ornamentation, which can add flare to a musical piece for the virtuoso singers and instramentalists to show off their skills or used when repeating the same sections to make each repetition seem different.</p>
<div id="1EVvB_pri6Y" class="eleventy-plugin-youtube-embed" style="position:relative;width:100%;padding-top: 56.25%;"><iframe style="position:absolute;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" title="Embedded YouTube video" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1EVvB_pri6Y" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>This video gives a good overview of common ornamentations to embilish the music</p>
<p>There was growing awareness to use music to evoke emotions, or affects. Following the medical theory on humors at the time, where eating and refraining from certain foods can equilibrize the imablance of bodily humors, there was growing beleif that musical emotions were another method to counter with the imbalance of humours, or spirit vapours. Lorenzo Giacomini wrote in his <em>Oratoni e discorsi</em> that external factors like musical affects stimulate the body to alter the state of the humors. There was even a 17th century theory called the Doctrine of Affections, stating that different musical moods could and should be used to influences the affects of the listener.</p>
<p>In Baroque music, many pieces have distinctive movements, sections, or dances in a collection (called a suite). Each distinct section presents a well-defined emotional charactersitic. Though this structure of distinct sections was carried over by the past centuries, these pre-Baroque musical sections were church music used to accompany different parts of the service; not to evoke a certain emotion.</p>
<p><em>Here are some musical characteristics that defined the Baroque musical sound:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Melody
<ul>
<li>More diverse melodic lines to incorporate:
<ul>
<li>Dramatic virtuoso singing (melismas, Da Capo Aria)</li>
<li>Idiomatic writing; basically melodies specifically written to show off the technical strentghs of each instrument</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Harmony
<ul>
<li>using the tonal system (the major and minor keys we know of today) rather than the modal system used in church music for the past centuries
<ul>
<li>this tonal system will be the basis of Western European Arts Music hamony</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>chromatic harmony was used for expressive effect</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rhythm
<ul>
<li>Predominantly a single rhythm to provide a steady pulse, but can be freer in vocal music (due to its influence from free-flowing church vocal music)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dynamics
<ul>
<li>Terraced dynamics: shifitng the volume suddnely from one level to another
<ul>
<li>this can be done by adding voices (actual human voice or instruments) to provide volume change or textural change
-gradual dynamic change was not possible at this time due to the technological limitations on instruments</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Texture
<ul>
<li>Preference of polyphony (many voices doing its own thing) over homophony (a main voice and an accompnying voice)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Instrumentation
<ul>
<li>the formation of the orchestra, a rather a stablized group of instruments that will eventually form what we know as the orchestra today, where they will contribute to the contrasting musical textures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>https://youtu.be/teh22szdnRQ
Here's an example. You can skip the &quot;monophony&quot; section (0:15-1:30) since it is not very relevant to this discussion</p>
<ul>
<li>Basso Continuo
<ul>
<li>an instrument or small ensemble that provide the harmonic founcation for the melody. This is usually the harpsichord in the background.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Below are some popular Baroque pieces to provide our examples:</strong></p>
<div id="3LiztfE1X7E" class="eleventy-plugin-youtube-embed" style="position:relative;width:100%;padding-top: 56.25%;"><iframe style="position:absolute;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" title="Embedded YouTube video" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3LiztfE1X7E" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>A. Vivaldi: Concerto No. 1 in E major, Op. 8, RV 269, &quot;Spring&quot; (La primavera) from <em>The Four Seasons (Le quattro stagioni)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>basso continuo on harpsichord</li>
<li>swelling on the strings; no vibrato (rapid pitch changing while sustaining on that note)</li>
<li>Violin's idiomatic writing - showing off the skills of the violin</li>
<li>Word painting - this was a new technique to show affects - a story/image setting that accompanies the music so the audience can follow the poem with what the music was expression: bird chirps (0:30), the river (1:15), the storm (1:49), people dancing in the field (6:27)</li>
<li>This ensemble used Baroque tuning (~415hz), which sounds flater than the pitches we are used to. Today, we would tune our instruments to A=440-42hz</li>
</ul>
<div id="RZHC7JBNhRk" class="eleventy-plugin-youtube-embed" style="position:relative;width:100%;padding-top: 56.25%;"><iframe style="position:absolute;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" title="Embedded YouTube video" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RZHC7JBNhRk" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>D. Scarlatti: Keyboard Sonata in E major, K.380</p>
<ul>
<li>Idiomatic writing on the harpsichord - showing off the harpsichordist's skills</li>
<li>Lots of ornamentation, room for the soloist to show off their improvisation skills on repetitive portions</li>
<li>terraced dynamics - due to instrument technicalities, the way to create &quot;loud&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; dynamics was to change the pitch (the same notes but more to the left for softer or right louder) and adding octaves to create more &quot;voices&quot;</li>
</ul>
<div id="5WVKyxFOCkY" class="eleventy-plugin-youtube-embed" style="position:relative;width:100%;padding-top: 56.25%;"><iframe style="position:absolute;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" title="Embedded YouTube video" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5WVKyxFOCkY" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>G.F. Handel: Rejoice Greatly from <em>Messiah</em> (HWV 56)</p>
<ul>
<li>Melisma - style of virtuosic singing by holding a syllable over a series of notes (in this example, Handel purposely put the melismas on the word &quot;rejoice&quot; to emphasize this word in 0:20-22 and 0:35-41)</li>
<li>Da Capo Aria (A-B-A form) - a musical form to show off with improvisation and ormanentation by the soloist in the repeats of the A sections (from 3:04 the repeat of this section has added ornamentation to sound different than the first by adding more notes)</li>
</ul>
<div id="Nnuq9PXbywA" class="eleventy-plugin-youtube-embed" style="position:relative;width:100%;padding-top: 56.25%;"><iframe style="position:absolute;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" title="Embedded YouTube video" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Nnuq9PXbywA" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>J.S. Bach: Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565 (The infamous Vampire tune)</p>
<ul>
<li>Counterpoint and the Fugue</li>
<li>The organ was a common instrument used in the Baroque era, especially for churches. Although, this is a secular organ piece</li>
<li>Idiomatic writing - showing off the organist's skills</li>
</ul>
<p>For many listerners, the first impression can be that it sounds quite busy with so many musical voices playing simultaneously and so much embellishments in a piece of music through variation in repeteating sections or a soloist showing off their skills. This is all a part of the &quot;ornate&quot; characterstic of Baroque music, and can seem very majestic and grand. It is quite common in advertisements and movies to use Baroque music to accompany a sense of grandeur or an intense emotion; like Bach's Toccata and Fugue being associated with a scary Vampire lair and Vivaldi's Spring used for joyous settings like a &quot;high tea&quot; restaurant.</p>
<p>Baroque music can be associated with the extravagence, but also hints at being perused by high-class members of society. Yes, these pieces were mostly written for royalty, nobility, and the church, which does explain why it feel grandiose and courtly, but it is also able to elicit a certain emotion and provide a source of entertainment. And to that, it does complete its goal well in today's audiences too.</p>
